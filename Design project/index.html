        <p>1. One of the most effective ways to manage your homework is by improving your sleep schedule.
             By getting an adequate amount of sleep each night, you will feel much more
             refreshed and less stressed. If you would like to make a sleep schedule for yourself, please check
             the "sleep schedule" link in the top middle.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>2. Organizing your homework is also a very effective way to deal with homework. Get in the habit of
             doing the hardest/longest homework first. This way, even if you forget something, it might be small
             enough for you to do at school(during lunch or recess,hopefully before your class).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>3. Be disciplined! If you do not do your homework after school, you will probably forget about it later
            in the day.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>4. Don't be ashamed to ask your friends for help. After all, isn't that what friends are for?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            5. If you know that you cannot finish your homework, tell your teacher. He/she will probably understand
            and give you an extention on your assignment.
